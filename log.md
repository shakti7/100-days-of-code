### Day 1: August 22, 2020, Saturday
[comment]:##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Practiced some problems based on linear search ,insertion in array and matrix multiplication.

**Thoughts**: I just revised some of the problems related array from codeforwin. Next time I'll will doing more questions.

### Day 2: August 23, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Revised array concepts.  Solved some basic problems like deletion of duplicate elements from array, deletion from specified postion,rotating array,printing unique elements in array.

**Thoughts**: Today I was not in a mood to solve problems as things were not going as planned. So, I felt irritated, but still I have to find 1 hour to solve problems. I know that I didn't gave my best today. I hope in upcoming days I'll give my best.I'll develop interest by continuing  this. I am planning to start Linked list in this week.

### Day 3: August 24, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finally started with Data Structure concepts. Today I solved traversing,insertion,deletion in singly Linked List.

**Thoughts**: I had committed to myself to start this topic and now I felt happy. I am planning to start solving problems online.

**Reference**:  Data structures And Algorithms Made Easy by Narasimha Karumanchi.

### Day 4: August 25, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with the same topic and only learnt to reverse the singly linked list.

**Thoughts**: I am thinking to give more time to this topic. I need to understand this topic completely . I'll  solve few more questions and then switch on to new topic.

### Day 5: August 26, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Still continuing with the same. I solved 3 problems from HackerRank.

**Thoughts**: I was having a lot of work load today so I started bit slowly. So, today I couldn't start with new topic. Tommorrow I'll be starting Doubly Linked List and if possible I'll complete the LinkedList topic.

### Day 6: August 27, 2020, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started with Doubly Linked List .I solved traversing and insertion in DLL.

**Thoughts**: I will be completing DLL tommorrow and thinking of solving problems from geeksforgeeks.

### Day 7: August 28, 2020, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing the same topic ,solved deletion and reversing Doubly Linked List.

**Thoughts**: I couldn't solve problems from gfg due to some issues. I am planning to start this from next Wednesday. Tommorrow I'll be starting circular linked list.


### Day 8: August 29, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I practiced Circular Linked List traversal using double & single pointer and insertion.

**Thoughts**: I'll be completing circular linked list sooner and start doubly circular list which will take a day or two.

### Day 9: August 30, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with the same topic, practiced deletion and reversing circular linked list.

**Thoughts**: Tommorrow I'll be completing the entire linked list. Till date I'm moving a bit slow to grab the concepts and I'll take few more days for revising the same chapter. 

## Day 10: August 31, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I practiced Doubly Circular linked list traversal and insertion.


**Thoughts**: I'll be starting with stack soon. But first I will take some time to revise complete Linked List and solve some extra problems related to the topic.


## Day 11: September 1, 2020,Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I practiced deletion in doubly circular linked list,which completes linked list topic. Then I practiced 2 problems from GeeksForGeeks.

**Thoughts**: As I was able to solve only 2 problems from gfg in one hour even after completing linked list topic,so I felt little bit demotivated. Tommorrow I may be starting with stack.

## Day 12: September 2, 2020,Wedesday

**Today's Progress**: Today I started stack Data Structures. I learned its concepts then practiced implementation of stack using array (i.e, push , pop, display operation).

**Thoughts**: As I started a new topic ,so I wanted to start it slow. Tommorrow I'll be practising implementation using Linked List.

## Day 13: September 3, 2020,Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I practiced implementation of stack using linked list.

**Thoughts**: Due to other workload I couldn't proceed further. Tommorrow I'll practice some problems.

## Day 14: September 4, 2020,Friday

**Today's Progress**: I practiced 2 problems from geeksforgeeks which included finding middle element of linked list and printing nth element from end of a linked list.

**Thoughts**: As I felt sleepy today,so, tommorrow I will be solving more problems on linked list.

## Day 15: September 5, 2020,Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I practiced 3 problems from geeksforgeeks which included delete all occurrences in a linked list, delete middle element in a linked list and add 1 to a number represented as linked list.

**Thoughts**: I am solving easy problems from gfg as I am unable to face medium and high level problems.

## Day 16: September 6, 2020,Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I practiced 2 problems from geeksforgeeks which included rotation of linked list upto k nodes and remove duplicates from an unsorted linked list.

**Thoughts**: I think I have practiced enough problems on linked list. Tommorrow I'll be starting a new topic.

## Day 17: September 7, 2020,Monday

**Today's Progress**: Today I started Queue Data Structures. I learned its concepts then practiced implementation of queue using array and linkedlist (i.e, enqueue , dequeue, display operation).

**Thoughts**: Tommorrow I will be starting circular queue and learn its applications.


## Day 18: September 8, 2020,Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I practiced Circular queue implementation using linked list and array.

**Thoughts**: Tommorrow I will be starting Doubly ended queue and learn its applications.

## Day 19: September 9, 2020,Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I practiced 2 problems from geeksforgeeks which included sorted insertion for circular linked list and queue implementation using two stack.

**Thoughts**: Today I couldn't start doubly ended queue as I had a lot of workload. I could not provide much time to coding due to this.

## Day 20: September 10, 2020,Thursday

**Today's Progress**: I practiced doubly ended queue implementation using circular array.

**Thoughts**: Tomorrow I will be learning some concepts of priority and multique, and then I'll solve few problems.

## Day 21: September 11, 2020,Friday

## Day 22: September 12, 2020,Saturday

**Today's Progress**: First I revised recursion then I started Tree data structures and learned its types & properties. I practiced implementation of binary tree using linked list.

**Thoughts**: I faced some problem in learning tree. Tomorrow I'll be learning its traversal ,insertion and deletion.

## Day 23: September 13, 2020,Sunday
