### Day 2: August 23, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Revised array concepts.  Solved some basic problems like deletion of duplicate elements from array, deletion from specified postion,rotating array,printing unique elements in array.
**Thoughts**: Today I was not in a mood to solve problems as things were not going as planned. So, I felt irritated, but still I have to find 1 hour to solve problems. I know that I didn't gave my best today. I hope in upcoming days I'll give my best.I'll develop interest by continuing  this. I am planning to start Linked list in this week.

### Day 3: August 24, 2020, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finally started with Data Structure concepts. Today I solved traversing,insertion,deletion in singly Linked List.

**Thoughts**: I had committed to myself to start this topic and now I felt happy. I am planning to start solving problems online.

### Day 4: August 25, 2020, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with the same topic and only learnt to reverse the singly linked list.

**Thoughts**: I am thinking to give more time to this topic. I need to understand this topic completely . I'll  solve few more questions and then switch on to new topic.

### Day 5: August 26, 2020, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Still continuing with the same. I solved 3 problems from HackerRank.

### Day 8: August 29, 2020, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Today I practiced Circular Linked List traversal using double & single pointer and insertion.

**Thoughts**: I'll be completing circular linked list sooner and start doubly circular list which will take a day or two.

### Day 9: August 30, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Continuing with the same topic, practiced deletion and reversing circular linked list

**Thoughts**: Tommorrow I'll be completing the entire linked list. Till date I'm moving a bit slow to grab the concepts and I'll take few more days for revising the same chapter.
