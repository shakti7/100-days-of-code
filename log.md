### Day 2: August 23, 2020, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Revised array concepts.  Solved some basic problems like deletion of duplicate elements from array, deletion from specified postion,rotating array,printing unique elements in array.
**Thoughts**: Today I was not in a mood to solve problems as things were not going as planned. So, I felt irritated, but still I have to find 1 hour to solve problems. I know that I didn't gave my best today. I hope in upcoming days I'll give my best.I'll develop interest by continuing  this. I am planning to start Linked list in this week.
